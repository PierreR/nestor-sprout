This is how I have installed Nestor:

* Install Ruby, sudo gem install sproutcore to get all the dependencies.
* sudo gem uninstall sproutcore (looks stupid but well ...)
* Go in a directory where you wish to install sproutcore from the master git branch.
* git clone git://github.com/sproutit/sproutcore-abbot.git abbot
* cd abbot
* mkdir frameworks
* cd frameworks
* git clone git://github.com/sproutit/sproutcore.git
* cd ..
* git clone git://github.com/etgryphon/sproutcore-ui.git scui
* make a symlink toward abbot/bin in a dir included in your PATH
* go to a place where you want to install Nestor
* git clone git@github.com:PierreR/nestor-sprout.git nestor
